  <p>Over last year I have travelled many places such as Marmaris (Turkey), Barcelona (Spain), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Milan (Italy), Dubai (UAE) and Al-garve (Portugal). As you can see travelling is one of the main things I enjoy doing whilst not studying. Other hobbies would include playing Football with friends and family at either the local community centre or at Goals. I also regularly go gym to ensure fitness and this is mainly done by focusing on cardio and calisthenics.<br><br> Here are some videos from my adventures:
